# ParlourSolitaire
An iOS iPad solitaire game from 2011.

I wrote this classic solitaire game (*patience*) for fun using a card engine I created. I wanted the game to look pretty and realistic to depart from the rather garish computer solitaire games we grew up playing. There were other things that I disliked in other soliatire games, like a timer, that I sought to avoid. I also dislike solitaire games that immediately tell you when you **have no moves** rather than let the user make that determination.

Of the variations of solitary card games, Patience (this one) is admittedly probably my least favorite. Probably because I lose so often.
